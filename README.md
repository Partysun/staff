Staff is a toolkit for dead-simple usage out of the box promts and llms in your project and command line.

DRY principle, magic flow is a core principle.

IDEA:

Any good prompt combined with a llm is a pure magic. And you don't need to repeat yourself and find a good prompt, you can find well-prepared by community grimoires (combination of prompt, agents, functions & llms or only a prompt) then you learn this grimoire and can you use it on any text. Staff can help you with mastering your grimoires. Be brave in your path.

Current state is WIP.
